# Processing Model Outputs

Let's say you have a cat and two dogs at your house. 

If both dogs are in a room together, they are best buds, and everything is going well.

If the cat and dog #1 are in a room together, they are also good friends, and everything is fine.

However, if the cat and dog #2 are in a room together, they don't get along, and you may need
to either pull them apart, or at least play a pre-recorded message from your smart speaker
to tell them to cut it out.
